Key Requirements:
- User Authentication: Email/password system with tier management (Free, Basic Pro ₹199/mo, Advanced Pro ₹499/mo, Premium Pro ₹799/mo). Use JWT for sessions.
- Freemium Model: Integrate Stripe for subscriptions with price IDs. Include psychological nudges like upgrade teasers (e.g., "Upgrade for unlimited AI insights"), 7-day Pro trials auto-triggered after consistent usage, social proof messages (e.g., "82% of Pro users complete 30% more tasks"), progress bars for limits, and loss-aversion countdowns.
- Free Tier: Basic todo lists (add/edit/delete tasks), manual prioritization, unlimited tasks but with ads, 50-task monthly limit, and limited AI features (e.g., 5 Conversational Task Refiner calls/day, basic streaks in Habit-Loop Gamification).
- Pro Tiers: Unlock advanced AI features, remove ads/limits, and add integrations. Gate access via middleware (e.g., check_tier(feature)).
- AI Features (Core + New):
  - Natural Language Task Entry: Use OpenAI GPT-4o to parse inputs into structured tasks with deadlines/priorities.
  - Smart Optimization: Reorder tasks via AI based on urgency, user patterns, and dependencies.
  - Predictive Insights: LLM-generated tips, forecasts, and chat-based assistant.
  - Conversational Task Refiner: POST /refine endpoint (rate-limited in Free); LLM prompt-chaining to rewrite and decompose tasks into JSON task-graphs.
  - Auto-Schedule-to-Calendar: Endpoint /autoschedule; reinforcement learning policy in policy.py (mock weights, placeholder for nightly retrain) that weighs deadlines, task effort, meetings API, and energy heuristics to output calendar events JSON.
  - Focus Forecast: Cron job in forecast.py using time-series model (e.g., Temporal Convolutional Network) on sleep data (via Google Fit/Apple Health), calendar load, and historical completions; outputs peak-focus windows, break slots, and burnout risk as JSON (gated to Advanced Pro+; Premium adds 7-day ahead heat-map).
  - Habit-Loop Gamification: In habit.py with behavioral clustering and Thompson Sampling bandit algorithm; tracks streaks, XP, micro-rewards tailored to user personality (Free: basic; Pro: personalized challenges and power-ups like bonus XP boosts).
- Integrations: Google Calendar API (all tiers), plus Gmail/Outlook (Basic+), Zoom/Meet summary import (Advanced+), Slack/MS Teams and custom webhooks (Premium).
- Data & Model Blueprint:
  - Store habits, tasks, and user data in database tables (e.g., users, tasks, habits).
  - For ML: Include placeholders for model training (e.g., reinforcement learner rewards: -schedule-delay - context-switch cost; time-series inputs: calendar density, timestamps).
- UI: Mobile-responsive React app with clean design. Pages: Dashboard (tasks, Focus Forecast card, streak bar), Calendar (Auto-Schedule button), Insights (predictive tips), Chat Interface (for AI queries and Task Refiner), Settings (tier upgrades with nudges like modal after limit hit: "Unlimited clarifications save ~17 min/day – Upgrade for ₹6.60/day").
- Monetization Nudges: Subtle prompts after task additions (e.g., after 5th Refiner: upgrade sheet), instant gratification pop-ups (e.g., "42 min saved today ✨"), status badges (e.g., "Focus Guru" on shared lists), and progressive unlocks (e.g., banked XP grayed out in Free).
