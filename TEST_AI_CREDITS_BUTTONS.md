## What I Added

**Two new testing buttons in the Admin Dev Tools modal:**

### 1. "1-Minute AI Credits Timer" Button
- **Color**: Orange highlight button to stand out
- **Function**: Sets a 1-minute timer instead of the normal 24-hour timer
- **Purpose**: Test AI credits reset without waiting 24 hours
- **Confirmation**: Asks "Set a 1-minute timer for AI credits reset?"
- **Success Message**: Shows current credits and confirms 1-minute timer is set

### 2. "Force Reset AI Credits" Button  
- **Color**: Red destructive button
- **Function**: Instantly resets AI credits to 0
- **Purpose**: Immediate testing of reset functionality
- **Confirmation**: Asks "Force reset AI credits to 0 immediately?"
- **Success Message**: Confirms credits have been reset immediately

## How to Access

1. Sign in as an admin user (one of the 4 authorized emails)

## API Endpoints Used

The buttons call these admin-only endpoints:
- `POST /api/ai-credits-test/set-test-timer/:userId` (1-minute timer)
- `POST /api/ai-credits-test/force-reset/:userId` (instant reset)

Both endpoints are secured with admin-only access.

## UI Features

- **Orange highlight** for the 1-minute timer button (makes it easy to find)
- **Red destructive styling** for the force reset button (clear warning)
- **Loading states** with spinning icons during API calls
- **Confirmation dialogs** to prevent accidental clicks
- **Toast notifications** showing success/error messages
- **Real-time updates** of AI usage counters after reset

## Perfect for Testing

Now you can easily test the AI credits system without waiting 24 hours! The buttons make it simple to:
- Test the reset functionality instantly
- Verify the 24-hour timer logic with a 1-minute test
- Reset credits on demand for development/testing
- Confirm the system works as expected

The AI Credits Scheduler is working perfectly, and now you have convenient admin tools to test it thoroughly! ðŸŽ¯
