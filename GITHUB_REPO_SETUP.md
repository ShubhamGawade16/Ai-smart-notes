# GitHub Repository Setup Required

## 🔍 **Current Status**
- Git is configured locally but repository doesn't exist on GitHub
- Remote URL has formatting issues
- Need to create GitHub repository first

## 📋 **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

1. **Go to GitHub.com**
2. **Click "New repository" (green button)**
3. **Repository name**: `Ai-smart-notes`
4. **Set to Public** (so friends can access APK)
5. **Don't initialize** (leave all checkboxes unchecked)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

## 🔧 **Step 2: Fix Git Remote in Replit Shell**

After creating the repo, run these commands:

```bash
# Remove malformed remote
git remote remove origin

# Add correct remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/ShubhamGawade16/Ai-smart-notes.git

# Force push to create repository content
git push -u origin main --force
```

## 🚀 **Step 3: Verify GitHub Actions**

After push:
1. **Check repository has files**
2. **Go to "Actions" tab**
3. **"Build Android APK" should start automatically**
4. **APK ready in "Releases" tab (10-15 minutes)**

## 📱 **Why This is Needed**
- GitHub repository must exist before pushing
- GitHub Actions workflow needs repository to trigger
- APK will be generated automatically once setup is complete

The repository creation is a one-time setup, then everything works automatically.
