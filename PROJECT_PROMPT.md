- AI Insights (with confidence scoring and expiration)
- Focus Sessions (with productivity scoring and interruption tracking)

## Monetization Psychology

### Upgrade Trigger Design
1. **Natural Friction Points**: Hit AI limits during productive workflows
2. **Value Demonstration**: Show time savings and productivity gains from premium features
3. **Social Proof**: Display success stories and productivity improvements
4. **Scarcity**: Limited AI calls create urgency without frustration
5. **Investment Framing**: Position as "investing in your productivity" not "paying for software"

### Feature Limitation Strategy
- Free tier provides genuine utility but creates natural upgrade points
- Each paid tier unlocks transformational capabilities, not just removes limits
- Premium features are previewed but locked, creating desire and understanding
- Usage analytics show potential benefits of upgrading

### User Journey Design
1. **Onboarding**: Immediate value with simple task management and light AI assistance
2. **Habit Formation**: 7-14 days of successful free tier usage
3. **Limitation Discovery**: Natural encounter with AI call limits during engaged use
4. **Value Realization**: Clear demonstration of time saved and productivity gained
5. **Upgrade Decision**: Psychological readiness with compelling value proposition
